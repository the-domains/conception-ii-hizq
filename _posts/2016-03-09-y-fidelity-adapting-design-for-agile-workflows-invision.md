    description: "A portfolio site for a UX professional, though, is unique because it's both. For UX and UI designers, your website is more than just descriptions of your work - it is your work.

description: "Beautiful, pixel-perfect design comps invite people to get tapping and clicking. They solidify a vision in the minds of customers and stakeholders. For UI designers, it's tangible proof of hours of effort-another trophy for their Dribbble portfolio. But in agile workflows, monolithic, high-fidelity mockups can quickly get out of sync."
